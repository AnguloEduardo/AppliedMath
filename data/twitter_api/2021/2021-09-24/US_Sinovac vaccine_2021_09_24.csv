1441384108458917888	2021-09-24 12:48:45	@sarahkhan556 I had the Moderna vaccine. My first vaccine, I had no reaction. My second vaccine, I was a bit achy and feverish for about 36 hrs. Nothing major. Had I not been retired, I could have worked with no problem. And, I barely felt the jabs. Get it done. It’s less painful than dying.	Moore, OK
