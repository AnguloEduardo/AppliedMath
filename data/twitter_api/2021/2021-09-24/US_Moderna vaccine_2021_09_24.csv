Bring proof of vaccination, preferably your vaccine card that lists your previous vaccinations. Only Pfizer boosters will be available. Moderna and J&amp;J boosters are not recommended at this time.

1441496107117391872	2021-09-24 20:13:48	@CDCgov @CDCDirector Why would you want to reduce the amount of vaccine to half in Moderna booster when there are already so many breakthroughs with a full dose??? And when can we get this booster? Soon plz!!!	Mishawaka, IN

Jab #2 laid me out for a week, #1 for 5 days. ALL OF IT is better than risking #COVID19. #MaskUp #GetVaccinated https://t.co/Kil9jnySGV	Shiloh, IL
1441440713485340675	2021-09-24 16:33:41	@yeahnaa333 @Alxsimovic @Michigan_Noah 1/ I am fully vaccinated (Moderna vaccine). I might have caught the #DeltaVariant back in June 2021 but I only had a bad taste in my mouth for 8 days.	La Riviera, CA
1441439762452209667	2021-09-24 16:29:54	@CDCDirector CDC Director Dr. Walensky please approve booster shots for the moderna vaccine as soon as possible.  I want my 93 year old mother fully protected with a moderna booster shot.  Walgreens is waiting for you to approve the moderna booster shots.	Arabi, LA

I had no problems with my heart before this moderna vaccine! I need to get in contact with the inventor Robert W Malone. @RWMaloneMD https://t.co/EU9jW9xSKR	La Habra, CA
1441384108458917888	2021-09-24 12:48:45	@sarahkhan556 I had the Moderna vaccine. My first vaccine, I had no reaction. My second vaccine, I was a bit achy and feverish for about 36 hrs. Nothing major. Had I not been retired, I could have worked with no problem. And, I barely felt the jabs. Get it done. It’s less painful than dying.	Moore, OK

1441237699210334213	2021-09-24 03:06:59	Y’all don’t find it weird that the FDA ain’t said shit about the Moderna vaccine yet? If the shit ain’t approved why’s it still being distributed when there’s an approved option?	Bronx, NY
1441230550329479171	2021-09-24 02:38:34	@sarahkhan556 I’ve had the Moderna vaccine. I didn’t have any side effects. I got a Moderna booster and my arm was sore for a few days and I was tired for awhile.	Lewiston, ME
1441207450179293190	2021-09-24 01:06:47	@zybowskipjr @Fanatics @VintageDet Amazing! So did I! I received the Moderna vaccine which I truly believe is the very best based upon what I've seen out there. 👍👍	Phoenix, AZ
