It's done this way because IF there is an FDA approved vaccine AVAILABLE by law they have to use it INSTEAD of any vaccine still under EUA. Meaning IF Comirnaty  was available, they can't use J&amp;J, Moderna or Pfizer BioNTech.","Indiana, USA",0

1450498762464534538,2021-10-19 16:27:08,@mitchellreports @kavitapmd I am #FullyVaccinated and got #Moderna back when I was first eligible. When my 6 months are “up” I believe I’m going to just get Moderna again. I have only heard positive about it and don’t see why I should take an injection of a vaccine with a less efficacy.

1450492436648800265,2021-10-19 16:02:00,I got 2 doses of the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine. I saw no reason or benefit to switch and got it for my 3rd dose. In fact there’s an advantage because there will always be more effectiveness and safety data for a homologous boost vs heterologous. Same for Moderna stay the course,"Houston, TX",30
