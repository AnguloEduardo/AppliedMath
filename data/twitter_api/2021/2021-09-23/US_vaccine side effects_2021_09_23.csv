Thewhole thing is a mess and I appreciate your views and your own experience with this. I’m not ever gonna push the vaccine on anyone. One has to do the due diligence and make the choice that’s best for them.	Ohio, USA
1441021062825844745	2021-09-23 12:46:08	@makominogue Yep. So, you had to get polio, small pox, measles, typhoid vaccines, and a raft of others… but you’re afraid to get the j&amp;j COVID vaccine? https://t.co/wrQNMkD1Cc	Mount Vernon, VA
1440877612276981763	2021-09-23 03:16:07	@PreetBharara J &amp;J makes eye drops too. That's a great vehicle. Imodium too. So many possibilities. They have hundreds of products to sneak in some vaccine!	Frisco, CO

My wife is 58 I’m 62 with multiple medical conditions. I experienced 0 side effects, my wife had a little queasiness for a few hrs. Otherwise OK. Be smart &amp; getrdone.	Nebraska, USA
1441134691717877766	2021-09-23 20:17:40	@ChristopherHahn The vaccine is poison. The side effects outweigh the good. I’ll stick with my natural immunity. Thanks, though.	Sandy Springs, GA

1441108696130490372	2021-09-23 18:34:22	@SenMannyDiazJr Sir, hospitals are full of COVID patients. They aren’t full of people suffering vaccine side effects. Vaccines work and are safe. You literally have no idea what you are talking about. Also, please get yourself and your family vaccinated. https://t.co/QF7DMzEjFb https://t.co/ZjEQdYHzpu	St Petersburg, FL

I’m against mandating them. This isn’t a side. This is an experimental vaccine given that we have no clue the long term side effects. You guys can be test dummies. It fits the narrative	Whitney, NV
1441106729521930240	2021-09-23 18:26:33	@CaptinDeckerSTR Got the Pfizer vaccine; all 3 shots! (Booster because I am immuno compromised). No side effects whatsoever but also our daughters &amp; son-in-laws were fine by taking Tylenol 6 hours after &amp; another 2 doses. You’ll be fine it’s better than getting Covid. Thanks for getting it!	Phoenix, AZ
1441102828026544130	2021-09-23 18:11:03	@CaptinDeckerSTR I got the Moderna vaccine and had absolutely zero side effects.  I was lucky.  My arm wasn’t even sore.  I took Tylenol before both shots and before bed each time.	Georgia, USA
1441101068490850306	2021-09-23 18:04:03	@CaptinDeckerSTR First of all Don't be scared of the Shot! I had the vaccine on April 16 and 29, first shot arm pain for 3 day's it Pfizer. 2nd shot no side effects I was fine. And still feel fine. No big deal! It depends on your body	Oakville, CT
1441100693998223372	2021-09-23 18:02:34	@Patriotmom81 @skarbluv_iwona @mikepompeo Any side effects from the vaccine are minuscule to side effects from having Covid. Stop it with your anti-vax misinformation	Los Angeles, CA
1441094948602793995	2021-09-23 17:39:44	@HydeThoughts It’s not experimental. The vaccine is still better I agree, but ivermectin is used around the world without issue. And the side effects are only if you overdose which there would be no reason to do in this context. Story still doesn’t make sense.	Nashville, TN
1441075078519685127	2021-09-23 16:20:47	So, hey, everyone! Just letting you all know that I got my covid vaccine booster a couple weeks ago and I can safely report that:1. I have not become magnetized 2. My 5G service still works3. I have had no lasting side effects (only a fever and chills the first night)😉😆	Washington, DC

1441038748037222400	2021-09-23 13:56:25	@CaptinDeckerSTR Minimal side effects for me: arm was sore for a few days, and I was really fatigued for a bit, but that was it. I had the Moderna 2-shot vaccine .	Phoenix, AZ

Medication is taken way more often than a vaccine period. Insulin is taken several times throughout day by injection. Vaccines are not taken that often so it will not have the same side effects as regular meds	Round Rock, TX
1440892078733643776	2021-09-23 04:13:36	@Sith_Lord42 @maybe19 @ryan_ramshaw @DarrenPlymouth Except nah. We're all are very well aware of vaccine side effects, like I said, and educate our patients as such. You're just big mad I'm right and, I might add, sound a bit off your rocker, sir.	Washington, DC
1440855952769511427	2021-09-23 01:50:03	@Crass_S @BallingerMom Absolutely fucking not. I got vaccinated, but no way in hell would I have Bryn take the covid vaccine. Im almost 40 whatever side effects this may have in the future I will deal with (I have lived a good life). Im not going to do it to her, when there are so many unknowns.	Knoxville, TN

Because If You Can Basically Conduct Trials With 6 BILLION HUMANS. AND NOT HAVE ANY MAJOR ISSUES THAT MEANS LONGER TERM EFFECTS ARE NOT THERE. ✊🏽	Florida, USA
1440829625240674304	2021-09-23 00:05:26	About to take this Covid vaccine finally.   Been wrestling with this for a long time.  Even though we may not know what may happen in the future as far as side effects.    Nine hopefully..., I've seen to many people I know pass away the last few months. https://t.co/heSnilnG6E	Enterprise, AL
