I know what the vaccine does as I asked medical professionals about it. I did my research. I’m not going to listen to the rankings of a stranger. This has always been a health issue, not a “me, me, me” issue. 🙄","Pasadena, CA",0
1450123713152749568,2021-10-18 15:36:49,@Matthew_Kupfer So vaccine against COVID not as effective when a co-morbidity exist?  This is exactly one of the points against all the “analytics” around COVID deaths btw more broadly,"Cramerton, NC",0
1450094070064300032,2021-10-18 13:39:02,Now Fauci says J&amp;J should have been a 2 dose vaccine. Anyone who would put their lives in the hands of this man is crazy! NOW I KNOW WHY IT TAKES 10 TO 15 YEARS TO APPROVE NEW MEDICATIONS!,"Mesa, AZ",0

1449889328616939520,2021-10-18 00:05:28,@ashishkjha @J_my_sci Recently travelled to PR to visit family. Had to show vaccine card or negative COVID test to leave airport.  Had text messaging surveillance updates daily. Then you need to show vaccine cards to eat in restaurant and $300 fines for not wearing masks in stores! PR is awesome!,"Clemmons, NC",41
