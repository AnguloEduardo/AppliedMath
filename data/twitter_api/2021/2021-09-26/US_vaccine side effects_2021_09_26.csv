And they don’t know what the side effects are.","Phoenix, AZ",0

My spouse is a liver transplant and has had no side effects from his three jabs of the Pfizer vaccine. Get the vaccine. Help save lives. Also, please be an organ donor. That too saves lives.❤️✌️🙌🏻","Colorado Springs, CO",0

We’ve lost almost 700,000 Americans, it’s sad you choose to be so cavalier about that. Hope you haven’t lost anyone you care about. There are more side effects from aspirin than the vaccine.","Omaha, NE",0
