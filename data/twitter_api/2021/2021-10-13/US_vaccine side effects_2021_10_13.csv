What were your side effects, and do you have any medical conditions?Everyone I've known to get the Pfizer vaccine (including myself) have only had a sore arm and some fatigue, including my girlfriend's immunocompromised father who's in his mid 60s. https://t.co/1shLkH3jbV","Mobile, AL",0

You have antibodies to the form of Covid you got but not the variants- vaccines cover the variants. The vaccine doesn’t stop you from getting Covid, it stops it from being severe.","Ventura, CA",0
