Today he basically said he believes he has natural immunity and is not necessarily scared of getting COVID again and that there is a small chance of side effects with the vaccine.","New Port Richey, FL",0

1442592738243854336,2021-09-27 20:51:25,@kevin_hairless @ChiefinWahoo @TheKitastrophe @brohrbach It’s a federal crime to knowingly file a false claim about vaccine side effects and they make that pretty obvious before trying to fill out a VAERS form. I’d expect that’s a pretty big deterrent to people lying on a VAERS form so it makes sense to assume claims are mostly true.,"Red Hook, NY",0

People respond differently. You may have a sore arm, headache, or legs feel heavy, but you'll survive. Don't be afraid. Go get your shot. ❤","Indiana, USA",0

1442533979496886272,2021-09-27 16:57:56,@jack_msw @houseofbones @jennylynnpalmer @JoyAnnReid I'm not edgy... the fear of Covid based on survivability is illogical and the cult like fervor over an experimental vaccine which isn't a vaccine and has been found to have terrible side effects is asinine,"Missouri, USA",0
