1441905613303390208,2021-09-25 23:21:02,@OANN It is utterly irresponsible to give vaccine shots to 5-11 yr. old school age children for covid- side effects on children can be so devastating! Bad enough they have to wear a masks all day long putting mandates on them. Taking covid vaccine shots-could be FATAL to their health,"Blue Springs, MO",0

It is an analysis of the side effects. People seem to have a terrible time sticking to the topic at hand and throw up unrelated graphs.","Morristown, NJ",1

I do not take any analysis as the last word, but I do assess it on a sliding scale of credibility, keeping in mind institutional interests of the source. Kaiser scores well.","Morristown, NJ",1

Getting infected after vaccination is not a side-effect, nor is transmitting Covid after getting vaccinated. Entirely different topics.","Morristown, NJ",1

1441725540860407812,2021-09-25 11:25:29,The vaccine does neither of those things. Look at Israel. You got a jab because you were scared. It doesn't protect those around you and you can still die of the virus. Now you just have the no idea if the long term side effects from the jab bonus also https://t.co/6IfqKLoOJU,"Cape Coral, FL",6
