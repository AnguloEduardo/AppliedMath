1442503141681872900,2021-09-27 14:55:24,@CenterStageDS @Kody_Kox I agree. I’ve got several friends here at home who have had small to severe reactions to the vaccine. I took the J/J one and just got a bad fever for a day and then I was fine but there are others who have had it far worse. Forcing or mandating this just isn’t right IMO.,"North Carolina, USA",0
