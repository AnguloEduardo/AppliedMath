Well there is  enough data to show no side effects from the vaccine. Now we know what the long term effects are from covid. Still not enough? Why not?","Queen Creek, AZ",1

The side effects of taking that vaccine actually would kill me so to me it's a medical thing and I won't do it!","Sacramento, CA",0
1449754049012715521,2021-10-17 15:07:55,And also if the vaccine works why do you have to keep getting booster shots? Why is no one discussing the permanent side effects. Why did you all jump off a bridge out of fear? You are the ones that die first in the horror movie because you panic and run upstairs since it’s safe,"Delhi, OH",0

The approval makes sense given the data we have. There was no less testing for these vaccine than any other, they just were able to reallocate resources which allowed the testing phases to happen simultaneously.","Mishawaka, IN",0

The side effects on younger people are blood clots &amp;Heart problems . We don’t know the long term effects of this type of vaccine since it’s not like the other vaccines,"Oklahoma City, OK",0

Well worth any discomfort for the peace of mind of knowing if I get a breakthrough case it won't kill me, like it would have without the vaccine...thanks science! 💚💜","Jackson, MI",0
